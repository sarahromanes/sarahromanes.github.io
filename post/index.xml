      <description>Have you ever had one of those moments whilst teaching where the content blows your mind? Today, whilst teaching MATH1005 at the University of Sydney, that exact thing happened to me.
This weeks content was focused on teaching the students the introductions to linear modelling. A very strightforward topic, and one ususally understood well by first years. However, a twist in our teaching style left me with such an appreciation for the simpler explanations in statistics.</description>

      <description>Ah, back to reality!Last month, I was fortunate enough to be able to travel away from the cold Sydney winter over to Central and North America for a holiday and also to present my work on multiDA at JSM in Vancouver. Whilst at JSM, I was able to hear Earo present her work (along with Di and Rob) on making calendar plots in R, using data from pedestrian traffic in Melbourne (see more here).</description>

      <description>The Launch!Wow, what a launch! Thank you so much Jen, Dani, Steph, and Lisa for all your work setting up this launch! I canâ€™t wait to see what the future events will hold! I was lucky enough to be able to give a lightening talk describing my R journey below - of which I have summarised for those who could not be there! You can also find the slides here.</description>
